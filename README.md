# Godot Game Project
Personal godot project for practice

## About This Project

This project was created as a way for me to explore the Godot engine and to practice and maintain my coding skills. It's a personal learning project, focused on experimenting with scripting, scene structure, and gameplay logic.

If you're interested in reviewing the code:
- Go to `The Game/Scenes` for the scene logic
- The scripts are primarily located in `The Game/Scripts`, with the **Scene Scripts** being the most relevant
